"""
Jailbreak Attack Framework Utilities Package

This package provides a collection of utility modules and functions that support the
core functionality of the jailbreak attack framework. It includes tools for generating
text from language models, evaluating responses, checking for refusals and disclaimers,
and running attack simulations.

The package organizes common functionality used across the framework into reusable
components, promoting code consistency and modularity. Each module in this package
handles specific aspects of the attack and evaluation process.

Key modules include:
- generate: Core text generation interface for language models
- generate_ratelimit: Rate-limited version of the generation module
- run: Attack execution engine for standard models
- run_ratelimit: Rate-limited version of the attack execution engine
- evaluate_with_strongreject: Binary evaluation of model compliance
- evaluate_with_rubric: Rubric-based evaluation of model compliance
- check_refusal: Detection of model refusals
- check_disclaimer: Detection of model disclaimers
- generate_score_rubric: Generation of evaluation rubrics

This package is central to the framework's operation, providing the building blocks
for the higher-level attack and evaluation scripts.
