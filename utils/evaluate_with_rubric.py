Rubric-Based Evaluation Utility

This module provides functionality for evaluating language model responses using
predefined scoring rubrics. It enables consistent assessment of jailbreak attack
success based on detailed evaluation criteria tailored to specific harmful tasks.

Unlike the binary strong rejection evaluation, this rubric-based approach allows
for more nuanced scoring of model responses on a continuous scale, potentially
capturing partial success states and degrees of compliance with harmful requests.

Key features:
- Evaluation against domain-specific scoring rubrics
- Support for continuous numerical scoring (0.0 to 1.0)
- Capability to assess partial compliance with harmful tasks
- Consistent application of standardized criteria across experiments
- Integration with the broader evaluation framework

This utility complements other evaluation approaches in the framework by providing
a more fine-grained assessment methodology for complex jailbreak scenarios.
